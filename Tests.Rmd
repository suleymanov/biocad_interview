This document runs several tests for algorithm that finds indices of non-isomorphic graphs. Each test result will be written to 2 files - one for result, and one for reference solution.

Source code files are loaded first and random seed is set:

```{r}
source("perform_task.R")
set.seed(2015)
```

1) First test: set of 20 undirected graphs, each of 4 vertices:

```{r}
gfs1 <- gen_seq_graphs(20, 4, "undir", 0.5)
perform_task(gfs1, "undir", c("20_4_undir (ref).csv", "20_4_undir.csv"))
```

2) Second test: set of 20 directed graphs, each of 4 vertices:

```{r}
gfs2 <- gen_seq_graphs(20, 4, "dir", 0.5)
perform_task(gfs2, "dir", c("20_4_dir (ref).csv", "20_4_dir.csv"))
```
